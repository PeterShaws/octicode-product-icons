# Octicons Product Icons

GitHubâ€™s [_Octicons_](https://primer.style/octicons/) (a version of them, that is) as a product icon theme for Visual Studio Code.

## Known issues

1. Several icons are misaligned because of the developer's current lack of knowledge about how to fix font file glyphs.
   - chevron (up, down, left, right)
   - close
   - plus
   - refresh
   - trash, trashcan
2. Many icons are missing and will fall back to the default Codicons because of the version of the icon font the developer has access to at the time.
